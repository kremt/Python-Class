You can turn off generative AI code-completion within Colab by tapping/clicking the settings icon in the upper right, tapping/clicking the AI Assistance section, and then deselecting \"Consented to use generative AI features\" and selecting \"Hide generative AI features\" (these settings may be returned to their previous states once you've completed this problem).\n",

    "*Write a program that uses a dictionary to assign “codes” to each letter of the alphabet. The letter A would be assigned the symbol %, the letter a would be assigned the number 9, the letter B would be assigned the symbol @, and so forth. The program should open a specified text file, read its contents, then use the dictionary to write an encrypted version of the file’s contents to a second file. Each character in the second file should contain the code for the corresponding character in the first file. Write a second program that opens an encrypted file and displays its decrypted contents on the screen.*\n",
